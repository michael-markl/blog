## About Me

Hi!
I'm Michael, a PhD student at the [University of Passau](https://uni-passau.de/en) in algorithmic game theory under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Tobias Harks](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/mathopt/team).
I study various variants of traffic assignment problems with a game theoretical perspective.
I am particularly interested in analyzing dynamic models, i.e., models that capture the interaction of traffic flow at different times of a day,
as well as multi-modal traffic infrastructure.
