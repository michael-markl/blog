summary: We study a dynamic traffic assignment model, where agents base their instantaneous routing decisions on real-time delay predictions. We describe a general mathematical model which, in particular, includes the settings leading to IDE and DE. On the theoretical side we show existence of equilibrium solutions under some additional assumptions while on the practical side we implement a machine-learned predictor and compare it to other static predictors.

## Abstract

We study a dynamic traffic assignment model, where agents base their instantaneous routing decisions on real-time delay predictions. We describe a general mathematical model which, in particular, includes the settings leading to IDE and DE. On the theoretical side we show existence of equilibrium solutions under some additional assumptions while on the practical side we implement a machine-learned predictor and compare it to other static predictors.
